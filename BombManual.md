Bomb Defusal Puzzles
====================

What, you thought you just attach your defusal kit and win the game? Think again.
This bomb requires you to figure out some puzzles devised by a fiendish terrorist
who just enjoys seeing people run around like headless chooks.

In case you need to know it, here are some handy tidbits of information.

Weapon categories
-----------------

If a group of weapons is described, no it's not called a "murder", that's crows.
These are the specific groups of weapons and which weapons count:

* Pistols - Glock, P2000, USP, Five-SeveN, Berettas (dual or single), P250,
  Tec-9, CZ75a, Desert Eagle (Deagle), and R8
* Shotguns - Mag-7, Nova, Sawed-Off, XM1014
* SMGs (Smigs) - Bizon, Mac-10, MP5, MP7, MP9, P90, UMP-45
* ARs (Assault Rifles) - AK-47, AUG (Bullpup), FAMAS, Galil, M4A4, M4A1, SG553
* Snipers - Scout (SSG-08), AWP, G3SG1, SCAR-20
* LMGs - M249, Negev
* Grenades - HE, Smoke, Flash, Molotov (and Incendiary), Decoy
* Equipment - Zeus (taser), Defusal Kit, Kevlar, Helmet (which may be together)m
  Health Shot
* Full-Auto - AK-47, AUG, FAMAS, Galil, M4A4, M4A1, SG553, M249, Negev, SCAR-20,
  G3SG1, CZ75a, Bizon, MP5, P90, MP7, MP9, UMP-45, Mac-10, XM1014
* Scoped - Scout, G3SG1, SCAR-20, AWP, AUG, SG553
* Starter - Glock, USP, P2000
* Non-damaging - Flash, Smoke, Decoy, Defusal Kit, Kevlar, Helmet, Health Shot

Take particular note of which items are NOT in certain categories. For instance,
a G3SG1 does not count as an assault rifle, and an R8 does not count as
non-damaging, despite its typical in-game behaviour.

Weapon attributes
-----------------

Once you have found a weapon, you will often be asked to report on some specific
feature of it. These are the inherent attributes of a weapon, although not all
weapons have all of these attributes:

* Magazine (clip): the number of bullets that can be fired between reloads ("30")
* Ammunition (reserve): the total number of bullets you carry ("90")
* Armor penetration: the percentage of damage that ignores armor ("90")
* Price: the cost in dollars to purchase the weapon ("3300")
* Kill award: the number of dollars earned for one single kill ("300")
* Mobility: the fastest you can run while holding this weapon ("220")
* Keyword: the identifier that can be used in a buy command ("aug")
* Menu sequence: the keys to press to purchase this weapon ("b44")
* Burst: number of shots that can be fired in a burst ("1")

In the unlikely event that counter-terrorists have not all memorized these exact
values for every single weapon ever encountered, it may be necessary to seek
alternative reference information. Keep it handy. You never know what you will be
asked for.

Comparisons
-----------

Rather than simply asking about an attribute of a weapon, some will ask you to
compare multiple weapons. There will be a small number of options, and you must
choose one of them - the greatest number, the smallest magazine, etc. Be very
careful when responding to a comparison; if you choose wrongly, the bomb will
immediately detonate! A comparison must be responded to with a specific command,
such as `"!solve <ak47/awp>"` - you must type exactly either `!solve ak47` or
`!solve awp` to proceed, and any other command starting `!solve` will kill you.
Some examples of comparison questions:

* "Which is more expensive - my collection of SMGs or my collection of pistols?"
  - "!solve <smg/pistol>"
  - Add up the total value of all SMGs on the ground (counting multiple times
    if there are duplicates) and the total value of all pistols
* "Which is less mobile - my least-mobile shotgun or my most-mobile AR?"
  - "!solve <shotgun/ar>"

Ties will not occur and must not be worn. There will always be a distinction.

Be extremely careful with these puzzles. They are finicky and require absolute
precision.

General notes
-------------

With simple numeric answers, just type them into chat. Use decimal (base 10) and
the commonly-used Arabic numerals `0123456789`, and for fractional parts, use
a decimal point (`98.5`). Do not include punctuation, monetary symbols, percent
signs, etc.

The same person must enter all the solutions in order to defuse the bomb. If one
person solves two puzzles and then another person attempts the third, the second
person must first enter the solutions to the first two puzzles. To see which
puzzle you need to solve next, just attempt to defuse the bomb.

Have fun, and remember: a five minute bomb timer is not an invitation to relax...
