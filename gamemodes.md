# Alternate game modes made available by Dr Zed

The drzed plugin creates a number of tools which can be put together in many
different ways, creating a variety of game modes. Here are just a few that can
be built using the plugin and some cvars.

## Arms & Armor

Start with an Arms Race map and configuration. Grant kill awards. Permit
healing, which means setting a price etc. Killing enemies now ranks you up
but also lets you purchase something - maybe grenades, maybe healing, maybe
the heavy assault suit (if it's enabled).

Example config file: [armsarmor.cfg](https://github.com/Rosuav/tf2server/blob/master/steamcmd_linux/csgo/csgo/cfg/armsarmor.cfg)

## Flashbean

Remove all default weapons from everyone. Give everyone a flashbang with
infinite ammo. Reduce everyone's hitpoints to 1. Now you have to bean people
with flashbangs!

Example config file: [flashbean.cfg](https://github.com/Rosuav/tf2server/blob/master/steamcmd_linux/csgo/csgo/cfg/flashbean.cfg)

## Leave No Man Behind

Classic mode. Add in a second hitpoint pool wherein you are crippled before
you actually die. Teammates can revive you, or you can revive yourself by
getting a kill on an enemy (or winning the round).

Example config file: (none yet)
